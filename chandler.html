		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>Chandler Muriel Bing is a fictional character from the NBC sitcom Friends, portrayed by actor Matthew Perry.[2] Chandler was born to Nora Tyler Bing, an erotic romance novelist, and Charles Bing, a gay female impersonator and star of a Las Vegas drag show called "Viva Las Gay-gas" as Helena Handbasket. He is of Scottish and Swedish descent.[citation needed] He is an only child and is apparently from an affluent family.[citation needed] Chandler's parents announced their divorce to him over Thanksgiving dinner when he was nine years old, an event which causes him to refuse to celebrate the holiday in his adulthood and develop his notorious sense of humour as a defense mechanism. It is revealed in season 1 that he went to an all-boys high school.

		Chandler's best friend is Joey Tribbiani, who is his roommate. He previously lived with his good friend Ross Geller. He met Ross' sister, Monica Geller, and her friend, Rachel Green, while celebrating Thanksgiving at Ross' parents' house. Chandler was the first person to know about Ross' love for Rachel.[citation needed] He moved to New York City and lives across the hall from Monica and, through her, meets Phoebe Buffay. Chandler has a very good sense of humor, and is notoriously sarcastic. He attributes his sarcasm as a defense mechanism he developed due to his parents' divorcing when he was a child. He is the highest earning member of his friends' circle on account of responsible income management, having learned the value of money from a young age.[citation needed] He suffers from commitment issues, but later marries Monica at the end of season 7. In season 10, he and Monica go on to adopt twins. His birthday is celebrated on the 8th of April, even though there are misconceptions that it is on the 24th of April.</p>

		<h2>Appearances</h2>
		<p>Chandler works in 'Statistical analysis and Data reconfiguration,' but loathes it, although it pays well.[citation needed]

		Chandler was Ross Geller's roommate in college. Chandler met his future wife Monica Geller while celebrating Thanksgiving with the Geller family during his first year at college. On a tip from Monica, Chandler later moved to Apartment #19 in Greenwich Village, Manhattan, across the hall from Monica and her roommate Phoebe Buffay. After his roommate Kip moves out, actor Joey Tribbiani moves in with Chandler, who becomes his best friend.

		Ross and Chandler have been best friends since their freshman year in college, where they were roommates. They were in a band together. Chandler also learned "Hug and Roll" from Ross when he was dating Janice.[3]

		Until moving in with Monica, Chandler shared an apartment with Joey. Chandler and Joey's apartment is an important focal point for the series as one of the few meeting areas of the gang. The two form a close and enduring friendship, and get into many humorous situations. In the pilot episode of the sequel series Joey, Joey's sister Gina briefly expresses her belief that Joey and Chandler were a gay couple.</p>



		<h2 id="career">Career</h2>

		<p>Chandler works in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.[citation needed] Despite disliking his job, Chandler stays because they keep giving him promotions and raises, eventually becoming boss to his old workmates. His friends do not understand what he does; during the contest for Monica and Rachel's apartment, Rachel guesses "Transponster" for his job title. This results in Chandler and Joey winning the apartment.

		In the episode "The One Where Emma Cries", Chandler falls asleep during a meeting and on waking, realizes that he had agreed to head the new division in Tulsa. Chandler quits his job on Christmas, so that he can fly home to New York to be with Monica. Monica helps Chandler secure a job in advertising through an old colleague of hers. Much to Chandler's dismay, he begins as an unpaid intern. However, his more mature approach eventually pays off, and he secures a full-time job in the business as a junior copywriter, which he enjoys much more than his previous career.</p>


		<h2>Development</h2>
		<p>Chandler is afraid of commitment and had the fewest relationships out of all the Friends.[citation needed] Despite all this, he and Monica are the first to have a committed marriage that doesn't end in divorce.

		At Ross' wedding in London, Monica and Chandler sleep together and decide to begin dating. They try to keep their relationship secret, as they are unsure about how the others would react. Eventually, however, they all find out and give their blessing. Things briefly become strained when Monica reveals that she had initially been looking for Joey for a one-night-stand, but they reconcile. Their wedding takes place during the finale of season 7. In the final episode of the series, Monica and Chandler adopt twins, due to their inability to conceive.

		Before his relationship with Monica, Chandler has an on-and-off relationship with Janice Hosenstein (Maggie Wheeler). She is a regular feature in his life, even though he regrets dating her and keeps ending their relationship in season 1. He calls her in season 2 out of fear of being alone, only to find out she is married and pregnant. In the season 2 finale, they meet after unknowingly chatting with each other online when her husband cheats on her, and they quickly get back together. The relationship lasts through the first few episodes of season 3, with Chandler genuinely infatuated by her, but when she kisses her husband whilst in the midst of her divorce, Chandler urges her to go back to her husband, not wanting to destroy her family. However, Janice makes further appearances later in the series, even after they have both married other people.

		Kathy (Paget Brewster) makes an appearance in the fourth season of Friends. Chandler sees her in Central Perk and asks the gang if he should ask her out, only to learn that she was already waiting for a date with Joey. Chandler and Kathy then fall for each other even though she is dating Joey. This causes huge friction between Joey and Chandler, but this is resolved and Chandler and Kathy get together and begin dating. She is an actress, and Chandler gets extremely paranoid when she shares a sex scene with her co-star prompting a big fight between the two. Chandler's paranoia drives Kathy into having an affair with the co-star, and Chandler and Kathy split up.</p>
